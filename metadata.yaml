description: "Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl is an autobiography by a young\
  \ mother and fugitive slave published in 1861 by L. Maria Child, who edited the\
  \ book for its author, Harriet Ann Jacobs. Jacobs used the pseudonym Linda Brent.\
  \ The book documents Jacobs' life as a slave and how she gained freedom for herself\
  \ and for her children. Jacobs contributed to the genre of slave narrative by using\
  \ the techniques of sentimental novels \"to address race and gender issues.\" She\
  \ explores the struggles and sexual abuse that female slaves faced on plantations\
  \ as well as their efforts to practice motherhood and protect their children when\
  \ their children might be sold away.\nJacobs' book is addressed to white women in\
  \ the North who do not fully comprehend the evils of slavery. She makes direct appeals\
  \ to their humanity to expand their knowledge and influence their thoughts about\
  \ slavery as an institution.\nJacobs began composing Incidents in the Life of a\
  \ Slave Girl after her escape to New York, while living and working at Idlewild,\
  \ the Hudson River home of writer and publisher Nathaniel Parker Willis. Portions\
  \ of her journals were published in serial form in the New-York Tribune, owned and\
  \ edited by Horace Greeley. Jacobs' reports of sexual abuse were deemed too shocking\
  \ for the average newspaper reader of the day, and publication ceased before the\
  \ completion of the narrative.\nBoston publishing house Phillips and Samson agreed\
  \ to print the work in book form if Jacobs could convince Willis or abolitionist\
  \ author Harriet Beecher Stowe to provide a preface. She refused to ask Willis for\
  \ help and Stowe never responded to her request. The Phillips and Samson company\
  \ closed. Jacobs eventually signed an agreement with the Thayer & Eldridge publishing\
  \ house, and they requested a preface by abolitionist Lydia Maria Child, who agreed.\
  \ Child also edited the book, and the company introduced her to Jacobs. The two\
  \ women remained in contact for much of their remaining lives. Thayer & Eldridge,\
  \ however, declared bankruptcy before the narrative could be published.\n From Wikipedia\
